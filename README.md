Whenever a user requests to a specific service, if he is not authenticated by the system, he will be redirected to the login page of Authentication Service. Once user login, he receive a response with a signatures from Authentication service. It will be use to sign every further request to service.

When a service receives request with embeded signature from user, it will use the private key of user in database to regenerate the signature. If the signature regenerated by service matches with the one in user's request, service will process the request. Otherwise, it response with 404 Error code.
